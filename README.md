This is a demo of Angecryption (http://corkami.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/angecryption/): 
I draw two pngs: Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vador.
With Angecryption, encrypting Anakin Skywalker turns it into Darth Vador. And reciprocally, decrypting Darth Vador gives back Anakin Skywalker.

To test, do:
<pre>
$ cd anakin
$ make all
</pre>

I am not the author of Angecryption. 
Angecryption is Ange Albertini 2014, BSD Licence - with the help of Jean-Philippe Aumasson

I am merely the author of the two PNGs of Anakin and Darth Vador ;) - GIMP + tablet.
